"1.0"

- Finish section on relations
- Write about fixing the bug (NBG, maybe some ZF)
- Write intro to categories based on what happened with functions of sets
- Write section on structuralism, summarizing points from benaceraf's paper and the nlab page on the topic

loose thoughts:


I think there is a lack of exercises in which they are asked to construct an example of something. My students were weak at this.

Consider adding more on arithmetic and perhaps even modular arithmetic, division algorithm, euclidean algorithm, etc.
Perhaps with fast travel paths that sort of tell you what theorems to accept in order to teleport to a section

I think there is a lack of WRONG proofs, which makes people get used to trusting everything they read.
Many more exercises are needed in which wrong proofs are caught. Somehow.

Ex idea:
- something comparing P(X)xP(Y) and P(XxY)
- the problems on my take home final!
